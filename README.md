# qaoa-queens

We use QAOA to find solutions to the N queens problem. The $N$ queens problem can be viewed as a generalized exact cover problem, which can then be reduced to an exact cover problem. We solve the resulting exact cover problem using QAOA, with the corresponding Hamiltonian being obtained via the technique used in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10499](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10499).
