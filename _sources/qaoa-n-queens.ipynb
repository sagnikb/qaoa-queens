    "## The exact cover problem and its generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a (countable) set $X$ and a collection $S$ of subsets of $X$, a subcollection $S^\\star$ of $S$ is called an exact cover of $X$ if any two sets in $S^\\star$ are disjoint, and the union of all sets in $S^\\star$ is $X$. We need to find such an exact cover if it exists. We can represent this in matrix form as follows. Let the matrix $M$ have as many rows as there are sets in $S$, and as many columns as there are elements in $X$. For each row of the matrix (corresponding to each set $s$ in $S$), let the $i$<sup>th</sup> element be $1$ if the corresponding element is in $s$ and zero otherwise. Then, the objective is to find a set of rows such that their sum is the all-ones vector. The set $X$ can be thought of as a set of constraints, and the choice of rows as selections. The objective is then to select a set of rows so that each constraint is satisfied by exactly one selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generalized exact cover problem divides $X$ up into two sets. In one set, the constraints must be satisfied by exactly one selection (these are called the primary constraints), while the secondary constraints may be satisfied by at most one (that is, either zero or one) selection. In matrix language, we need to find a set of rows that sum to $1$ in the columns corresponding to the primary constraints and either $0$ or $1$ in the columns corresponding to the secondary constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can frame the $N$ queens problem in this framework as follows. Let the matrix $M$ have $N^2$ columns and $6N - 6$ columns. The first $N$ columns corresponds to the $N$ files (columns) of the chessboard. The next $N$ corresponds to the $N$ ranks (rows). The next $2N - 3$ columns correspond to the diagonals, with the first and last diagonal omitted because they only consist of one square each. Similarly, the last $2N - 3$ columns correspond to the reverse diagonals. Each row $M$ corresponds to a particular position of a queen on the board; it has ones in the columns corresponding to the rank, file, diagonal and reverse diagonal that the square is in, and zeros everywhere else. The objective is to find a selection of rows (or, equivalently, positions of queens) such that they sum to $1$ for each column corresponding to ranks and files (because each rank and file must contain a queen), and either $0$ for $1$ for each column corresponding to a diagonal or a reverse diagonal (because it is not necessary for each diagonal/reverse diagonal to contain a queen).\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix is generated by the following code. For each row in the matrix (which goes from $1$ to $N^2$ corresponding to the $N^2$ choices of squares), it places a $1$ in the index for the rank, file, diagonal and reverse diagonal of the square, and zeros everywhere else. "
